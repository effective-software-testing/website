Are you interested in using this book in your classroom? Universities are more and more focusing on software testing. Unfortunately, most books out there are either too theoretical or too practical. The _Effective Software Testing: A Developer's Guide_ book gives students a pragmatic and solid view on modern software testing practices. 

I have been using my own book to teach software testing at Delft University of Technology. I can help you in understanding how to adopt this book. Send me an e-mail and we schedule a conversation about it. 

We will discuss:

* How to flip the classroom using my book as the main source of study
* How to make use of our 50+ coding exercises together with our open-source feedback tool
* How to engage students with pragmatic discussions and live coding
* How to obtain a nice discount for your students to buy the book
* How to properly assess your students
