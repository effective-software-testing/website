Tests should be fast
Tests should be cohesive, independent, and isolated
Tests should have a reason to exist
Tests should be repeatable and not flaky
Tests should have strong assertions
Tests should break in case the behavior changes
Tests should have a single and clear reason to fail
Tests should be easy to write
Tests should be easy to read
Tests should be easy to change and evolve
