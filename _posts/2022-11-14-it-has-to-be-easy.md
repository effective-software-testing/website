One of the biggest truths when it comes to developer testing is that **it has to be easy**! 

If it's not easy, we'll simply don't do it. We'll find lots of different excuses, such as "I don't have time", or "Ah, I don't really need to test this", or "It's not worth it". But the thing is: no one says these things if writing the test takes just a few minutes.

* It should be easy to unit test any component of the system. 
* It should be be easy to control any part of the system through, say, mocking. 
* It should be easy to write integration tests, without developers having to write dozens of boilerplate lines of code. 
* It should be easy to build up complex entities with a few lines of code.
* It should be easy to set up data in the database if the test requires it. 
* It should be easy to write larger e2e tests if the team decides to go for it. 
* It should be easy to simulate external systems and their contracts.

If you want your team to write tests all the time, you don't need much. **Just make it easy.** In the next post, I'll show you examples.
