title: "What's the root cause of your lack of testing?"

Whenever you gather a team to discuss their insufficient testing efforts, common responses include:

* We lack knowledge on how to create effective tests.
* We lack understanding of best practices for testing X and Y.
* We don't have the proper tools for writing tests.

In my experience, although these issues can be obstacles, they aren't the root cause of the problem. To uncover the underlying issue, you need to dig deeper. Based on my experience, the primary reason for inadequate testing often lies in the absence of a testing mindset and culture.

**If you're searching for a solution to help your team overcome testing challenges, don't focus solely on bringing the latest and greatest testing tools. Instead, focus on changing their mindset and fostering a testing culture.**
